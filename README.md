CITATION for all the references taken...

1. I took the reference for the footer from the mdBootStrap to look it like a simple and clean. https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/navigation/footer/
2. I took the portfolio template from the Start Bootstrap website because I found the template appealing and user-friendly. https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume
3. The classes for the icons I used to show the programming tools and other links like github, linkedIn, etc are taken from Font Awesome Icons. https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/font-awesome-icons-classes.php#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20if%20an%20icon%20class%20is%20user%20then,all%20accessibility%20arrow%20chart%20currency%20file%20type%20form
